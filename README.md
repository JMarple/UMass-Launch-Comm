# UMass Launch Team Communications 2016
Communications for UMass Launch Team

The goal for this code is to create a way to communicate information from a rocket to a ground control station.  The rocket will have a raspi connected to a 900Mhz long-range radio, where information will be sent to a laptop on the ground using the mavlink protocol.   

There are two parts for this project:
 - The code running on the raspi that will send out all the information
 - The code running on the laptop which will save the information and present it in some way if wanted.  
 
TBD
